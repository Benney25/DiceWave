user inputs the length of the password they want
delimit each word with random symbols
print to a tkinter window
save generated passwords to a sql file
    is the sql file the database? or is the sql file just scripting?


Main Window
Dicewave.py

Python Logic
Logic.py

Word List
Wordlist.sql

            Do not store the passwords generated after the end of the session.

mysql word list

could use this as a 'microservice' for an account information tracking software also using python, sql, tkinter.
