position, line, python
    I searched this because I don't understand the way that python file management works. I will need to do more research into it later - for now, guess work will have to do.

put a wait python function
    i searched this because I assumed that my functions and variables might have been executing too quickly for the files to be closed and reopened
    i ended up noticing that I opened the file a second time but did not reclose it
    I also noticed that a large portion of my program was global, so I checked for variable interference, closed files once I was done with each individual use of the file for each individual action, and combined closely related actions into one function.

how to concatenate function output python
    I need to concatenate the outputs together in order to generate a single string password, but I'm not sure how.

            I cannot concatenate functions
            print writes directly to terminal
            I need to produce strings instead, which I can concatenate
            then print separately
                def var():
                    return: "getpass? or getword?"
                in either case, move for loop to the function which concatenates the returned strings

i cannot concatenate functions - and my results are output to terminal - maybe if I output my results to a file, I can then call the output from the file and concatenate it?  this sounds inefficient
