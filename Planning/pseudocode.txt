Scripting - Logic.py
    
    def diceroll(): 
        roll random 1-6
        concatenate previous concatenated result and new result
            x += roll
        if func() has repeated (input) times, end
        else, repeat
            (while loop) w3schools
    delimit each word with random symbols

    #the number of times that func1 will iterate before closing

func1
    var1 = random 1-7776
    mysql call (var1)

    if =/= (input1) then repeat

    #if what? What is equal to input1?

    #how to count the number of iterations of this function
    #or
    #how to repeat this function (input1) number of times.
    #is a for loop most appropriate here?
    #for func1 in input1 return ????????????
    #for x in input1?
    
    #beginning
    #while x < input1
    #rest of function

    Concatenate result sequentially with +=

print (func1)
    #print text to window, replace this with tkinter option
