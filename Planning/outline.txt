Scripting - Logic.py
    func1
        Roll 1-6
        x += result (store result as x, concatenate previous result with new result)
        loop until result is greater than 9999
        store number as:_? output to:_?
    func2
        run func1 (input) times
        output to tuple
        for each number in the tuple, call the corresponding word from Wordlist.sql
        output each word sequentially into a new tuple
    func3
        tuple = (\!,\@,\#,\$,\%,\^,\&,\*,\(,\),\_,\+,\{,etc...)
        roll for random symbol in tuple (IMPORTANT: must specify tuple content as string)
        repeat (input -1) times
        output as tuple
    func4
        dance between wordlist tuple and delimiter tuple, concatenating the result beginning to end as a string 
        print result to a tkinter window
Word List - Wordlist.sql
    how do we find the word 
        by its associated number in an adjacent column?
        by row and column number?
        search parameters?
        is sql, mysql, or some other language most appropriate?
    how to get the files to interact and communicate with each other.
