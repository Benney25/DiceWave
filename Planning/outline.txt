Tkinter Window - DiceWave.py
    user inputs the length of the password they want by selecting how many words DiceWave will use to generate the password
        drop down box 1-5
    user presses a button that says 'generate'
    password is output to a text box on the screen and disappears after 1 minute
Scripting - Logic.py
    func1
        Roll 1-6
        x += result (store result as x, concatenate previous result with new result)
        loop until result is greater than 9999
        store number as:_? output to:_?
    func2
        tuple = (\!,\@,\#,\$,\%,\^,\&,\*,\(,\),\_,\+,\{,etc...)
        roll for random symbol in tuple (IMPORTANT: must specify tuple content as string {when/where?})
        repeat (input -= 1) times
        output as tuple
            (code can be executed like this, but maybe there is a simpler way)
    func3
        run func1 (input) times
        output to tuple
        for each number in the tuple, call the corresponding word from Wordlist.sql
        output each word sequentially into a new tuple
    func4
        dance between wordlist tuple and delimiter tuple, concatenating the result beginning to end as a string 
        print result to a tkinter window
    AltFinFunc
        func1
        +=
        func2
        while x < input
            else end
Was I attempting to use tuples for my while loops, in order to continue the loop until input# of indexes is met?

Word List - Wordlist.sql
    how do we find the word 
        by its associated number in an adjacent column?
        by row and column number?
        search parameters?
        is sql, mysql, or some other language most appropriate?
    how to get the files to interact and communicate with each other.
